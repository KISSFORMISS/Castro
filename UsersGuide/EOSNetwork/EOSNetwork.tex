\section{Equation of State}

\subsection{Standard \castro\ EOSes}

\castro\ is written in a modular fashion so that the EOS and network
burning routines can be supplied by the user. However, for the
examples presented later we use several EOS and network routines
that come with the \castro\ distribution.

\castro\ relies on routines to calculate the equation of state (EOS)
of a fluid, as well as a species network to define the components of
the fluid. The network optionally has the ability to do nuclear burning,
but for this section its main purpose is in defining the species so that
the EOS can calculate fluid properties that depend on composition, such
as electron fraction.

By default, \castro\ comes with the {\tt gamma\_law}
EOS. This represents a gamma law gas, with equation of state:
\begin{equation}
  P = (\gamma - 1) \rho e.
\end{equation}
The gas is currently assumed to be monatomic and ideal.
%The entropy comes from the Sackur-Tetrode equation. It lives in {\tt EOS/gamma\_law\_general}.

The equation of state interface is designed to accept a particular
type of Fortran derived data type (which for our purposes is analogous
to a C++ struct), the {\tt eos\_t}. It stores a complete set of thermodynamic
variables. When calling the EOS, you should first fill the variables
that are the inputs, for example with
\begin{align*}
  &\texttt{type (eos\_t) :: eos\_state} \\
  &\texttt{...} \\
  &\texttt{eos\_state } \% \texttt{ rho = state(i,j,k,URHO)} \\
  &\texttt{eos\_state } \% \texttt{ T   = state(i,j,k,UTEMP)} \\
  &\texttt{eos\_state } \% \texttt{ e   = state(i,j,k,UEINT) / state(i,j,k,URHO)} \\
  &\texttt{eos\_state } \% \texttt{ xn  = state(i,j,k,UFS:UFS+nspec-1) / state(i,j,k,URHO)} \\
  &\texttt{eos\_state } \% \texttt{ aux = state(i,j,k,UFX:UFX+naux-1) / state(i,j,k,URHO)}.
\end{align*}
We also provide variants of this, {\tt eos\_t\_1D}, {\tt eos\_t\_2D}, and {\tt eos\_t\_3D},
that are used within the \castro\ code and can be used in your own code too. For these,
we hold (respectively) 1D, 2D, or 3D arrays of the data corresponding to the 3D state data.
A 3D example of how to use this inside a function that operates over array bounds {\tt lo} to
{\tt hi} is:
\begin{align*}
  &\texttt{type (eos\_t\_3D) :: eos\_state} \\
  &\texttt{...} \\
  &\texttt{eos\_state = eos\_t\_3D(lo,hi)} \\
  &\texttt{...} \\
  &\texttt{eos\_state } \% \texttt{ rho(i,j,k) = state(i,j,k,URHO)} \\
  &\texttt{eos\_state } \% \texttt{ T(i,j,k)   = state(i,j,k,UTEMP)} \\
  &\texttt{eos\_state } \% \texttt{ e(i,j,k)   = state(i,j,k,UEINT) / state(i,j,k,URHO)} \\
  &\texttt{eos\_state } \% \texttt{ xn(i,j,k)  = state(i,j,k,UFS:UFS+nspec-1) / state(i,j,k,URHO)} \\
  &\texttt{eos\_state } \% \texttt{ aux(i,j,k) = state(i,j,k,UFX:UFX+naux-1) / state(i,j,k,URHO)}.
\end{align*}
The \texttt{eos\_state = eos\_t\_3D(lo,hi)} line initializes the individual arrays (e.g. {\tt rho}, {\tt T})
with the same array bounds as {\tt lo} and {\tt hi}.

\subsection{EOS Interfaces and Parameters}

Each EOS should have two main routines by which it interfaces to the
rest of \castro.  At the beginning of the simulation, {\tt eos\_init}
will perform any initialization steps and save EOS variables (mainly
\texttt{smallt}, the temperature floor, and \texttt{smalld}, the
density floor). Then, whenever you want to call the EOS, use
\[
  {\tt call\ eos (eos\_input, eos\_state)}.
\]
The first argument specifies the inputs to the EOS. The options
that are currently available are stored in
{\tt EOS/eos\_data.F90}, and are always a combination of two
thermodynamic quantities. For example, {\tt eos\_input\_rt} means
that we call the EOS with {\tt rho} (density) and {\tt T} (temperature)
and we expect the EOS to return the associated thermodynamic
quantities such as internal energy {\tt e} and entropy {\tt s}.

We note that for real (non-analytic) equations of state
in which $\rho$, $T$ and species are the independent variables, such
as the Helmholtz EOS, {\tt eos\_input\_rt} directly calls the EOS
and obtains the other thermodynamic variables. But for other inputs,
e.g. {\tt eos\_input\_re}, a Newton-Raphson iteration is performed
to find the density or temperature that corresponds to the given
input.

The {\tt eos\_state} variable is a Fortran derived type (similar to
a C++ struct). It stores a complete set of thermodynamic
variables. When calling the EOS, you should first fill the variables
that are the inputs, for example with
\begin{verbatim}
  eos_state % rho = state(i,j,k,URHO)
  eos_state % e   = state(i,j,k,UEINT) / state(i,j,k,URHO)
  eos_state % xn  = state(i,j,k,UFS:UFS+nspec-1) / state(i,j,k,URHO)
  eos_state % aux = state(i,j,k,UFX:UFX+naux-1) / state(i,j,k,URHO)
\end{verbatim}
Whenever the \texttt{eos\_state} type is initialized, the
thermodynamic state variables are filled with unphysical numbers. If
you do not input the correct arguments to match your input quantities,
the EOS will call an error. However, this means that it is good
practice to fill the quantities that will be iterated over with an
initial guess. Indeed, this initial guess is typically required for
equations of state that ierate over this variable, as the values
they are initialized with will likely not
converge. Usually a prior value of the temperature or density suffices
if it's available, but if not then use \texttt{small\_temp} or
\texttt{small\_dens}.

There are a few parameters that exist for all equations of state.
At present, the only one that hasn't been mentioned yet is
\texttt{eos\_assume\_neutral}, which if set to true means that
none of the atoms are ionized. Otherwise, by default we assume
full ionization. For now, only the gamma law EOS is configured
to permit this to be true.

If you are interested in using more realistic and sophisticated equations of
state, you should download the \href{https://github.com/BoxLib-Codes/Microphysics}{\tt Microphysics}
repository. This is a collection of microphysics routines that are compatible with the
\boxlib\ codes. We refer you to the documentation in that repository for how to set it up
and for information on the equations of state provided. That documentation
also goes into more detail about the details of the EOS code, in case you are interested in
how it works (and in case you want to develop your own EOS).

\section{Nuclear Network}

The nuclear network serves two purposes: it defines the fluid components used
in both the equation of state and the hydrodynamics, and it evolves those
components through a nuclear burning step. \castro\ comes with a {\tt general\_null}
network (which lives in the {\tt Networks/} directory). This is a bare interface for a
nuclear reaction network. No reactions are enabled, and no auxiliary variables
are accepted. It contains several sets of isotopes; for example,
{\tt Networks/general\_null/triple\_alpha\_plus\_o.net} would describe the
isotopes needed to represent the triple-$\alpha$ reaction converting
helium into carbon, as well as oxygen and iron.

The main interface file, {\tt network.f90}, is a wrapper function. The
actual network details are defined in {\tt Networks/general\_null/general\_null\_network.f90}.
It supplies the number and names of species and auxiliary variables, as
well as other initializing data, such as their mass numbers, proton numbers, and the binding
energies.

The burning front-end interface, {\tt Networks/burner.f90}, accepts a normal
\castro\ state MultiFab and converts it to a
{\tt eos\_t\_1D}, {\tt eos\_t\_2D}, or {\tt eos\_t\_3D} type (as defined
in the previous section), so that it can be sent to the back-end burning routine.
The network is designed to use the same EOS type that the EOS itself uses. It
accepts as input a given EOS state, and returns an updated EOS state. The
nuclear energy release can be computed by taking the difference of
{\tt eos\_state\_out \% e} and {\tt eos\_state\_in \% e}. The species
change can be computed analogously. The integration occurs over a
time interval of $\Delta t/2$, where $\Delta t$ is the hydrodynamics timestep.

If you are interested in using more actual nuclear burning networks,
you should download the \href{https://github.com/BoxLib-Codes/Microphysics}{\tt Microphysics}
repository. This is a collection of microphysics routines that are compatible with the
\boxlib\ codes. We refer you to the documentation in that repository for how to set it up
and for information on the networks provided. That documentation
also goes into more detail about the details of the network code, in case you are interested in
how it works (and in case you want to develop your own network).

\subsection{Required Thermodynamics Quantities}

Three input models are required of any EOS:
\begin{itemize}
\item {\tt eos\_input\_re}: $\rho$, $e$, and $X_k$ are input
\item {\tt eos\_input\_rt}: $\rho$, $T$, and $X_k$ are input
\item {\tt eos\_input\_rp}: $\rho$, $P$, and $X_k$ are input
\end{itemize}

The {\tt eos\_t} derived type holds a large number of thermodynamics
quantities, but not all of these are needed for basic
\castro\ operation.  The main quantties that any EOS in any mode needs to
supply, if they are not input, are:
\begin{itemize}
  \item {\tt eos\_state \% T}: the temperature
  \item {\tt eos\_state \% P}: total pressure
  \item {\tt eos\_state \% e}: the specific energy
  \item {\tt eos\_state \% gam1}: the first adiabatic index,
       $\Gamma_1 = d\log P / d\log \rho |_s$
\end{itemize}

Additionally the {\tt eos\_input\_re} mode also needs to supply:
\begin{itemize}
  \item {\tt eos\_state \% cs}: the adiabatic sound speed
  \item {\tt eos\_state \% dpdr\_e}: the derivative, $\partial
    p/\partial \rho |_e$---note that the specific internal energy, $e$
    is held constant here.
  \item {\tt eos\_state \% dpde}: the derivative, $\partial p /
    \partial e |_\rho$
\end{itemize}

For radiation hydro, the {\tt eos\_input\_rt} model needs to supply:
\begin{itemize}
  \item {\tt eos\_state \% cv}: the specific heat capacity.
\end{itemize}
Other quantities (e.g., entropy) might be needed for the derived
variables that are optional output into the plotfiles.

For burning, when the temperature equation is evolved, the EOS
needs to supply:
\begin{itemize}
\item {\tt eos\_state \% dhdX(nspec)}: the derivative of the
  specific enthalpy with respect to mass fraction at constant
  $T$ and $p$.  This is commonly computed as:
  \begin{equation}
    \xi_k = e_{X_k} + \frac{1}{p_\rho} \left (\frac{p}{\rho^2} - e_\rho \right ) p_{X_k}\enskip .
  \end{equation}
  with
  \begin{eqnarray}
p_{X_k} &=& \left .\frac{\partial p}{\partial \bar{A}} \right |_{\rho, T, \bar{Z}}
          \frac{\partial \bar{A}}{\partial X_k} +
          \left . \frac{\partial p}{\partial \bar{Z}} \right |_{\rho, T, \bar{A}}
          \frac{\partial \bar{Z}}{\partial X_k} \nonumber \\
        &=& -\frac{\bar{A}^2}{A_k}
          \left .\frac{\partial p}{\partial \bar{A}} \right |_{\rho, T, \bar{Z}} +
          \frac{\bar{A}}{A_k} \left (Z_k - \bar{Z} \right )
          \left . \frac{\partial p}{\partial \bar{Z}} \right |_{\rho, T, \bar{A}}\enskip,
\end{eqnarray}
\begin{eqnarray}
e_{X_k} &=& \left . \frac{\partial e }{\partial \bar{A}} \right |_{\rho, T, \bar{Z}}
        \frac{\partial \bar{A}}{\partial X_k} +
        \left .\frac{\partial e}{\partial \bar{Z}} \right |_{\rho, T, \bar{A}}
        \frac{\partial \bar{Z}}{\partial X_k} \nonumber \\
        &=& -\frac{\bar{A}^2}{A_k}
        \left . \frac{\partial e }{\partial \bar{A}} \right |_{\rho, T, \bar{Z}} +
        \frac{\bar{A}}{A_k} \left (Z_k - \bar{Z}\right )
        \left .\frac{\partial e}{\partial \bar{Z}} \right |_{\rho, T, \bar{A}}\enskip.
\end{eqnarray}
\end{itemize}
(see \cite{maestro:III}, Appendix A).
