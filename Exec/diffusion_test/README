This is a pure diffusion problem (no hydro).  It uses the explicit
diffusion solver in Castro to diffuse a Gaussian thermal pulse.
Because diffusion in Castro is incorporated in the energy equation, we
are solving:

d(rho e)/dt = k L T

where L is the Laplacian and k is the thermal conductivity.  Here we
assume that k is constant, but Castro does not require that
assumption.  For this problem, we take rho = constant, and using a
gamma-law EOS, we have e = c_v T, so this can take the form of a
diffusion equation as:

dT/dt = k/(rho c_v) L T = D L T

where D is the constant diffusion coefficient.

Because we are doing the diffusion explicitly, there is a constraint
on the timestep,

dt < 0.5 dx**2/D

Note: currently Castro does not enforce this directly.  For this problem,
we enforce it by setting castro.fixed_dt to a safe timestep.
